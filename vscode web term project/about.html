            <h2>Shoes4Dudes</h2>
        <p>What we do here at Shoes4Dudes is we take old worn down shoes, and fix them up to the best of our ability to then sell at a lower more affordable price for all to enjoy.
            <br> We just recently opened up our site to overseas foreign countries with international shipping.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>The very first idea/rough drafts for our company originally started back in 2016 and actually started in our little garage in sarnia ontario. <br>
            Our uncle made shoes from scratch and taught us at a young age how to make and repair many problems that can happen to your shoes. <br> 
            Ever since then we started a repair service and eventually thought one day what if we expanded repairng shoes to be almost like brand new and sell to those who need. <br>
            Ever since then we have grown with your support you've shown us and we appreciate it more than anything.</p>
